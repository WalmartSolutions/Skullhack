# Why?
Exotic was asked to dev the client due to him being bored he accepted adding some minor changes to the client's ClickGui but not really doing much.

After some time the owner (mousehvh) started to annoy WS by asking stupid questions and bothering the members when they we're busy.

Eventually becoming a big pain in the ass which lead to the leak.
